Welcome to Fam!

Fam is short for Flutter Assets Management. Fam is a tool that helps flutter developers 
manage asset files when developing projects.Fam is full-featured, stable in performance, 
beautiful in output and easy to use, and also supports platforms such as Windows, MacOS, 
and Linux. 

Fam has the following functions: 
1. Quickly configure references to new asset files,
2. Check or remove unused asset files,
3. Filter large resource asset files, specify file size and file type,
4. Deletes the specified asset file while clearing its reference configuration,
5. Naming conventions and duplicate name checking for asset files,
6. Rename asset files and asset reference classes.

Please execute commands such as `fam` or `fam help` or `fam -h` to get more detailed 
usage of Fam. If you encounter problems during use, you can ask questions at 
Fam_Issues(https://github.com/zhoushuangjian001/fam/issues), and I will answer them 
as soon as possible.
